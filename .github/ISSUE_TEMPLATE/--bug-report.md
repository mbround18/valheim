Hello there, thanks for using this image and sorry that you are having issues! You can go ahead and hit the preview button to see all of this with better formatting.

This repo uses discussions for handling bug reports and server issues as mentioned in a pinned issue here (#61). You can open up a discussion mentioning the bug by going to the [discussions](https://github.com/mbround18/valheim-docker/discussions) and opening a discussion then selecting "Help!" from "Select Category". From there you can give information on the issues you are having and hopefully get helpful feedback from the community! Be sure to sift through the top discussions to make sure that someone else didn't already post asking about the same issues!
