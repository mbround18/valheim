## Running on Linux Server

This repo bundles its tools in a way that you can run them without having to install docker!
If you purely want to run this on a Linux based system, without docker, take a look at the links below <3

- [Installing & Using Odin](./src/odin/README.md)
  The tool [Odin] runs the show and does almost all the heavy lifting in this repo. It starts, stops, and manages your Valheim server instance.
  
- [Installing & Using Huginn](./src/huginn/README.md)
  Looking for a way to view the status of your server? Look no further than [Huginn]! 
  The [Huginn] project is a http server built on the same source as [Odin] and uses these capabilities to expose a few http endpoints.
  
> Using the binaries to run on an Ubuntu Server, you will have to be more involved and configure a few things manually. 
> If you want a managed, easy one-two punch to manage your server. Then look at the Docker section <3 

## Running with Docker

> [If you are looking for a guide on how to get started click here](https://github.com/mbround18/valheim-docker/discussions/28)
>
> Mod Support! It is supported to launch the server with BepInEx but!!!!! as a disclaimer! You take responsibility for debugging why your server won't start.
> Modding is not supported by the Valheim developers officially yet; Which means you WILL run into errors. This repo has been tested with running ValheimPlus as a test mod and does not have any issues.

| -------- | --------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TZ       | `America/Los_Angeles` | FALSE    | Sets what timezone your container is running on. This is used for timestamps and cron jobs. [Click Here for which timezones are valid.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) |

#### Auto Update

| Variable                       | Default     | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AUTO_UPDATE                    | `0`         | FALSE    | Set to `1` if you want your container to auto update! This means at the times indicated by `AUTO_UPDATE_SCHEDULE` it will check for server updates. If there is an update then the server will be shut down, updated, and brought back online if the server was running before. |
| AUTO_UPDATE_SCHEDULE           | `0 1 * * *` | FALSE    | This works in conjunction with `AUTO_UPDATE` and sets the schedule to which it will run an auto update. [If you need help figuring out a cron schedule click here]                                                                                                              |
| AUTO_UPDATE_PAUSE_WITH_PLAYERS | `0`         | FALSE    | Does not process an update for the server if there are players online.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Auto update job, queries steam and compares it against your internal steam files for differential in version numbers.

#### Auto Backup

| Variable                          | Default        | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------- | -------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AUTO_BACKUP                       | `0`            | FALSE    | Set to `1` to enable auto backups. Backups are stored under `/home/steam/backups` which means you will have to add a volume mount for this directory.       |
| AUTO_BACKUP_SCHEDULE              | `*/15 * * * *` | FALSE    | Change to set how frequently you would like the server to backup. [If you need help figuring out a cron schedule click here].                               |
| AUTO_BACKUP_REMOVE_OLD            | `1`            | FALSE    | Set to `0` to keep all backups or manually manage them.                                                                                                     |
| AUTO_BACKUP_DAYS_TO_LIVE          | `3`            | FALSE    | This is the number of days you would like to keep backups for. While backups are compressed and generally small it is best to change this number as needed. |
| AUTO_BACKUP_ON_UPDATE             | `0`            | FALSE    | Create a backup on right before updating and starting your server.                                                                                          |
| AUTO_BACKUP_ON_SHUTDOWN           | `0`            | FALSE    | Create a backup on shutdown.                                                                                                                                |
| AUTO_BACKUP_PAUSE_WITH_NO_PLAYERS | `0`            | FALSE    | Will skip creating a backup if there are no players. `PUBLIC` must be set to `1` for this to work!                                                          |

Auto backup job produces an output of a `*.tar.gz` file which should average around 30mb for a world that has an average of 4 players consistently building on. You should be aware that if you place the server folder in your saves folder your backups could become astronomical in size. This is a common problem that others have observed, to avoid this please follow the guide for how volume mounts should be made in the `docker-compose.yml`.

#### [Huginn] Http Server

| Variable  | Default               | Required | Description                                                                                                                  |
| --------- | --------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ADDRESS   | `Your Public IP`      | FALSE    | This setting is used in conjunction with `odin status` and setting this will stop `odin` from trying to fetch your public IP |
| HTTP_PORT | `anything above 1024` | FALSE    | Setting this will spin up a little http server that provides two endpoints for you to call.                                  |

- `/metrics` provides a prometheous style metrics output.
- `/status` provides a more traditional status page.

> Note on `ADDRESS` this can be set to `127.0.0.1:<your query port>` or `<your public ip>:<your query port>` but does not have to be set. If it is set, it will prevent odin from reaching out to aws ip service from asking for your public IP address. Keep in mind, your query port is +1 of what you set in the `PORT` env variable for your valheim server.

### Docker Compose

### [Odin]

This repo has a CLI tool called [Odin] in it! It is used for managing the server inside the container. If you are looking for instructions for it click here: [Odin]

[Click here to see advanced environment variables for Odin](src/odin/README.md)

### [BepInEx Support](./docs/bepinex.md)

This repo automatically launches with the proper environment variables for BepInEx.
However, you have to install it manually in the container due to the fact that the modding community around Valheim is still in its infancy.

[Click Here to view documentation on BepInEx Support](./docs/bepinex.md)

### [Webhook Support](./docs/webhooks.md)

This repo can automatically send notifications to discord via the WEBHOOK_URL variable.
Only use the documentation link below if you want advanced settings!

[Click Here to view documentation on Webhook Support](./docs/webhooks.md)

### [How to Transfer Files](./docs/tutorials/how-to-transfer-files.md)

This is a tutorial of a recommended path to transfering files. This can be done to transfer world files between hosts, transfer BepInEx configs, or even to transfer backups.
