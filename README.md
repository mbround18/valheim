## Docker

> [If you are looking for a guide on how to get started click here](https://github.com/mbround18/valheim-docker/discussions/28)
> 
> Mod Support! It is supported to launch the server with BepInEx but!!!!! as a disclaimer! You take responsibility for debugging why your server won't start.
> Modding is not supported by the Valheim developers officially yet; Which means you WILL run into errors. This repo has been tested with running ValheimPlus as a test mod and does not have any issues.
> See [Getting started with mods]

### Environment Variables

> See further on down for advanced environment variables. 

| Variable                 | Default                | Required | Description |
|--------------------------|------------------------|----------|-------------|
| TZ                       | `America/Los_Angeles`  | FALSE    | Sets what timezone your container is running on. This is used for timestamps and cron jobs. [Click Here for which timezones are valid.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) |
| PUID                     | `1000`                 | FALSE    | Sets the User Id of the steam user. |
| PGID                     | `1000`                 | FALSE    | Sets the Group Id of the steam user. |
| PORT                     | `2456`                 | TRUE     | Sets the port your server will listen on. Take note it will also listen on +2 (ex: 2456, 2457, 2458) |
| NAME                     | `Valheim Docker`       | TRUE     | The name of your server! Make it fun and unique! |
| WORLD                    | `Dedicated`            | TRUE     | This is used to generate the name of your world. |
| PUBLIC                   | `1`                    | FALSE    | Sets whether or not your server is public on the server list. |
| PASSWORD                 | `12345`                | TRUE     | Set this to something unique! |
| AUTO_UPDATE              | `0`                    | FALSE    | Set to `1` if you want your container to auto update! This means at 1 am it will update, stop, and then restart your server. |
| AUTO_UPDATE_SCHEDULE     | `0 1 * * *`            | FALSE    | This works in conjunction with `AUTO_UPDATE` and sets the schedule to which it will run an auto update. [If you need help figuring out a cron schedule click here]
| AUTO_BACKUP              | `0`                    | FALSE    | Set to `1` to enable auto backups. Backups are stored under `/home/steam/backups` which means you will have to add a volume mount for this directory. |
| AUTO_BACKUP_SCHEDULE     | `*/15 * * * *`         | FALSE    | Change to set how frequently you would like the server to backup. [If you need help figuring out a cron schedule click here].
| AUTO_BACKUP_REMOVE_OLD   | `1`                    | FALSE    | Set to `0` to keep all backups or manually manage them. |
| AUTO_BACKUP_DAYS_TO_LIVE | `3`                    | FALSE    | This is the number of days you would like to keep backups for. While backups are compressed and generally small it is best to change this number as needed. |
| AUTO_BACKUP_ON_UPDATE    | `0`                    | FALSE    | Create a backup on right before updating and starting your server. |
| AUTO_BACKUP_ON_SHUTDOWN  | `0`                    | FALSE    | Create a backup on shutdown. |
| WEBHOOK_URL              | ``                     | FALSE    | Supply this to get information regarding your server's status in a webhook or Discord notification! [Click here to learn how to get a webhook url for Discord](https://help.dashe.io/en/articles/2521940-how-to-create-a-discord-webhook-url) | 
| UPDATE_ON_STARTUP        | `1`                    | FALSE    | Tries to update the server the container is started. |

### [Odin]

This repo has a CLI tool called [Odin] in it! It is used for managing the server inside the container. If you are looking for instructions for it click here: [Odin]

[Click here to see advanced environment variables for Odin](./docs/odin.md)

### [BepInEx Support](./docs/bepinex.md)

This repo automatically launches with the proper environment variables for BepInEx. 
However, you have to install it manually in the container due to the fact that the modding community around Valheim is still in its infancy.

[Click Here to view documentation on BepInEx Support](./docs/bepinex.md)


### [Webhook Support](./docs/webhooks.md)

This repo can automatically send notifications to discord via the WEBHOOK_URL variable. 
Only use the documentation link below if you want advanced settings!
